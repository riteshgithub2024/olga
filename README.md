Designing and Analyzing Wells:

1.Well Design and Placement:
   - Utilize deviation survey data to design various well configurations.
   - Employ well editor tools to position pressure nodes, valves, and casings within the system.

2.PVT Properties and Wax Analysis:
   - Generate PVT properties and wax precipitation curves.
   - Calculate the Wax Appearance Temperature (WAT) of crude oil using Multiflash.

3.Wax Deposition and Flow Regime Analysis:
   - Calculate wax deposition on the well walls.
   - Identify changes in flow regime over time and along the pipe length.
